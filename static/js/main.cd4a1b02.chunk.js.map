A sunny town in California best known for its good public schools, strip mall and summer county fair. It’s a nice place to grow up. It’s got plenty of greenery and well-mannered people. Nothing bad happens in Pleasanton.</p>\n\t\t\t<p>It’s where artist and painter Adrian Kay Wong and I grew up. I wanted to interview him because of this shared background and to understand how this place impacted his journey. Because Pleasanton didn’t create artists, and I didn’t know many artists, especially Asian ones.</p>\n\t\t\t<p>We visited him in his home/studio in Lincoln Heights on a rainy Saturday morning. Prior to the interview we joked about being the only Asian kids in elementary school. Pleasanton may have been a pleasant place to live, but back then it wasn’t diverse. You either conformed or hung out with the few Asian kids there. Our cultures were so different, it was hard to connect.</p>\n\t\t\t<ImgWrapper extraClass=\"BlogPost__ImgWrapper--right\" src={ObservationsRoom} />\n\t\t\t<p>It reminded me that even in happy places there is pain. Adrian mentioned the struggles his parefnts went through trying to care for him and his twin brother. Trying to empathize with his father, he said, “My parents were only planning for one kid, so when you have a twin, that $30,000 you need becomes $60,000. Even though we lived in Pleasanton, where everything’s really nice, I’m pretty sure he was stressing. That’s probably why he is the way he is.”</p>\n\t\t\t<p>He described his father as cold, analytical and withdrawn. Someone who didn’t communicate much or provide emotional support. Adrian said he had a strained relationship with his parents, yet he found himself going back to the themes of family and growing up, time and time again.</p>\n\t\t\t<p>In high school, I didn’t know Adrian was interested in art as a career. He talked more about being into sports than painting. He didn’t start painting until he got to high school, and by his account, only kept at it because he would get easy A’s. Without knowing much about the art world or considering it as a career, he had gotten accepted into some of the finest art schools in the country.</p>\n\t\t\t<p>“It wasn’t until a month before applying to college that I actually knew anything. And I was like, ‘Oh shit. There’re art schools out there that people go to, to learn about art?’” Even getting accepted was not compelling enough – he had still wrestled with attending UC San Diego to study statistical economics!</p>\n\t\t\t<p>Ultimately, his desire to leave Pleasanton and his parents forced him out of California and to the School of Arts in Chicago. Adrian recalled the shock of realizing how far behind he was when he first got to college: “When I got to school it was like, ‘Fuck! This is nothing like what I was doing! What the fuck am I doing here?’ The first week I had to create, the professor told me, ‘No one cares about your stuff.’”</p>\n\t\t\t<p>In high school art class, Adrian wasn’t taught how to think in concepts, only to draw realistically. Imagination didn’t extend beyond technical know-how. Yet by taking the plunge and going to art school, he was on his own. He had accepted an offer from his dad to take tuition support for art school with the understanding that that would be the last of his support.</p>\n\t\t\t<h2 className={classes['BlogPost__Pull-Quotes']}>The first week I had to create, the professor told me, “No one cares about your stuff.”</h2>\n\t\t\t<p>It’s during this period that he came to develop his perspective on work and art. He talked a lot about confusion. Not knowing this, or not knowing that. Being in a foreign place and having your perspective on something shattered completely can do that to you.</p>\n\t\t\t<p>Trying to find a starting point, Adrian mentioned, “I’m coming from a place where I didn’t know anything. It was like all 1,000 doors opened. And I don’t know which one to go through.”</p>\n\t\t\t<p>“I was doing stuff about family because I felt like it was a weighty topic,” he said. But eventually he avoided this overt messaging. He felt uncomfortable forcing the issue. However, variations on this subject matter would reemerge later under more subtle tones.</p>\n\t\t\t<p>How did he get to his creative voice? In other interviews, he cites the artists who influenced him: Scheeler, Diebenkorn, Lautrec, Matisse, Albers. Even to the untrained eye, these influences are seen in Adrian’s work. Yet I got the sense that these artists were mainly providing stylistic support. His direction was shaped and developed out of necessity.</p>\n\t\t\t<p>When Adrian moved to LA three years ago, he didn’t know anyone outside of a single cousin. He lived in a studio off Crenshaw and Adams, which he described as “not the best neighborhood.” Introverted and insecure, he put his focus into painting.</p>\n\t\t\t<p>“I threw out my bed because I was like, ‘I need more space to paint. That’s all that matters because I’m going to fucking die out here.’ I was sleeping in my closet in a sleeping bag for six months. I was like, ‘I need to paint. I need to paint.’”</p>\n\t\t\t<p>Chaos exploded in a confined space. Searching for his creative identity, Adrian kept painting, pushing out more and more, to the point where “walls started being covered. [He] had these tiny, narrow walk spaces because there’s shit everywhere.” Because of this, Adrian said, “I wanted me to be like the surface of the canvas. It was always pristine and nice because I wanted to be like that.”</p>\n\t\t\t<p>Reduce, reduce, reduce. “In order to simplify the things that were in front of me, I was spending less time doing detail.” His paintings are defined by clean lines, clean canvas, large blocks of color and devoid of clutter and the unnecessary. He yearned for cleanliness and order when everything in his life was the opposite.</p>\n\t\t\t<ImgWrapper extraClass=\"BlogPost__ImgWrapper\" src={ObservationsDesk} />\n\t\t\t<p>I asked him why he chose to focus on images that were recollections of his past. Of all the things he could have painted, the recurring imagery was based on literal memory. I could imagine him in his studio constantly reverting back to his past. It feels instinctual. What was it about his past that made it worth discussing?</p>\n\t\t\t<p>“I’m very nostalgic. My favorite director is Wong Kar Wai because I think he has this romantic view of things long gone but very clearly influencing you in the present. I think for as long as I remember I have had this thing with how I grew up or how I’m a nobody in the art world. Everyone knows more than me, so it’s always trying to prove that I have some sort of worth.</p>\n\t\t\t<p>For me in the present I have to figure out or navigate these past things where I was either too young, too immature or not knowledgeable enough to be able to handle them correctly. I worked through that in my own head. I’m still very stuck on those images, but I think nostalgia for things that aren’t necessarily good is still present in my painting.”</p>\n\t\t\t<p>Is he trying to rewrite his history? “In a way,” he said, “it’s a rewriting of how I see things.” If you could make sense of your past, would that allow you to move forward?</p>\n\t\t\t<h2 className={classes['BlogPost__Pull-Quotes']}>Everyone knows more than me, so it’s always trying to prove that I have some sort of worth.</h2>\n\t\t\t<p>Memory is fallible, malleable, even disorienting. By actively decluttering memories, Adrian condenses images down to a common denominator. The result is something that becomes relatable to many.</p>\n\t\t\t<p>One effect Adrian imposes on all his work is flattening 3D images into 2D, leaving no space for depth. To do this, he builds the image with geometric pieces that complement each other. There is no overlap between shapes.</p>\n\t\t\t<ImgWrapper extraClass=\"BlogPost__ImgWrapper--right\" src={ObservationsWall} />\n\t\t\t<p>“The distance between the base to the arm of a chair — they never overlap. The lamp doesn’t overlap with the shoulder. The person inside the chair is contained within the exterior, which never happens in real life. Try to take a photo that looks like this painting. It would be impossible because there’s too many angles of view that you have to composite together. You would never see just three legs of the chair like that and not see the bottom or the top of the chair.”</p>\n\t\t\t<p>How should we interpret this? Adrian said, “It’s like taking this real-life thing and morphing it into, I don’t want to say perfect, but there’s a perfect way of representing these images. The lamp is perfect in a way, but in the way that it all comes together.”</p>\n\t\t\t<p>There’s a desire for perfection, but a subtle acknowledgement that perfection is never achievable. Look at the lines and edges carefully. “There is imperfection. If you look close enough, you’ll see these lines aren’t exactly straight” because they are drawn by hand.</p>\n\t\t\t<p>Through the process of flattening, he leaves every shape in direct competition for viewers to see. He even went so far as to remove faces from his work because they stood out too much. He believes this allows you to better appreciate the beauty in the everyday.</p>\n\t\t\t<p>When I asked Adrian about his inspirations over the years, he actually started with his father. It was a surprising comment given how he talked about their relationship. “He’d never forced me to get A’s. It was just like, ‘You’re not working hard enough. You’re not working hard enough. You’re never working hard enough. Why are you doing this if you can work harder on this?’” he recalled as he quoted his father.</p>\n\t\t\t<p>I realized it’s this singular focus and intense work ethic that characterizes Adrian today. To survive in new environments without any direction, he said, “I didn’t have a backup plan because my mentality was, ‘This is all on me, so I’m going to put everything I have into this. Nothing else matters.’” Giving up wasn’t really an option.</p>\n\t\t\t<p>Given the forum, I wondered if he ever cared to reveal his Asian American identity through his art. The more we talked about his background, the more I felt like this identity was showing itself through his process, but he wasn’t discussing identity directly in his art. To this he told me about a time in college when an Asian American professor asked him why he didn’t paint Asian people. Adrian responded that he just painted people: “In my head I was like, ‘How do I paint an Asian person in the style that I do without relying on very stereotypical choices like yellow toned skin or black hair.’ That’s like all I can do.”</p>\n\t\t\t<p>But Adrian was still trying to figure out how he could incorporate identity into his work. He tinkered with some ideas until a friend told him not to force this discussion in his work and that his identity would be built into his artistic choices. His work would reveal it. As an example, Adrian believed his work to be aligned to how people might think about Asian aesthetics – clean, minimal, lacking excess, balanced. These attributes weren’t intentional in that way yet developed over time. One could argue it wasn’t a coincidence.</p>\n\t\t\t<p>To his generation, Adrian said, “I think a lot of times, growing up as an Asian American, you’re always trying to prove that you’re worth something, given that your parents went through a life harder than yours on paper, and you know you don’t fit into the world we live in now because we look different or we act in a certain way that’s different.” But it’s exactly this dynamic of trying to appease parents and others who can’t relate closely that obfuscates whether one can make proper decisions for himself.</p>\n\t\t\t<p>I wonder if there is a way to chart a new path that reconciles a desire to create a supportive environment for your work with a respect for the past and the people who wrote it. Sometimes this acknowledgment of the past affects our ability to be completely sure of our own beliefs. Tradition questions evolution. Historical facts dampen the possibilities of the future. “You have your work that you’re set out to do,” Adrian said, “and just have confidence in that... But in doing that craziness, do it extremely hard, as hard as you can.”</p>\n\t\t\t<ImgWrapper extraClass=\"BlogPost__ImgWrapper--right\" src={ObservationsBack} />\n\t\t</div>\n\t);\n\nexport default observations;","import React, { Component } from 'react';\nimport { Route } from 'react-router-dom';\n\nimport Aux from './hoc/Aux/Aux';\nimport Layout from './hoc/Layout/Layout';\nimport Home from './containers/Home/Home';\nimport About from './containers/About/About';\nimport Contact from './containers/Contact/Contact';\nimport Observations from './containers/BlogPost/Observations';\n\nclass App extends Component {\n\trender () {\n\t\treturn (\n\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t<Layout>\n\t\t\t\t\t{(setMainBackground, hideMainBackground)  => (\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<Aux>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<Route path=\"/\" exact render={(props) => <Home {...props} hideMainBackground={hideMainBackground} setMainBackground={setMainBackground} />} />\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<Route path=\"/about\" component={About} />\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<Route path=\"/contact\" component={Contact} />\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<Route path=\"/observations_of_a_common_past_adrian_kay_wong\" component={Observations}/>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</Aux>\n\t\t\t\t\t)}\n\t\t\t\t</Layout>\n\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t);\n\t}\n}\n\nexport default App;","import React from 'react';\nimport ReactDOM from 'react-dom';\nimport { BrowserRouter } from 'react-router-dom';\n\nimport './index.css';\nimport App from './App';\n\nconst app = (\n\t<BrowserRouter>\n\t\t<App />\n\t</BrowserRouter>\n);\n\nReactDOM.render(app, document.getElementById('root'));"],"sourceRoot":""}
