A sunny town in California best known for its good public schools, strip mall, and summer county fair. It’s a nice place to grow up. It’s got plenty of greenery and well-mannered people. Nothing particularly eventful happens there. It's where artist and painter Adrian Kay Wong grew up. We were familiar with Pleasanton and understood that the place didn’t birth artists, especially of Asian background.</p>\r\n\t\t\t\t<p>We visited him in his home studio in Lincoln Heights on a rainy Saturday morning. Prior to the interview, we joked about what it was like to be the only Asian kid in elementary school. Pleasanton may have been a pleasant place to live, but back then it wasn’t so diverse. And if your parents were immigrants and foreign to American culture, you faced dramatic differences in perspectives and norms at home and outside. You either conformed to the majority or risked being outcast, constantly picking sides to maintain the balance between youthful desire and familial customs.</p>\r\n\t\t\t\t<p>Even in happy places there is conflict that is less obvious, more below-the-surface. Adrian mentioned the struggles his parents went through trying to care for him and his twin brother. Trying to empathize with his father, he said, “My parents were only planning for one kid, so when you have a twin, that $30,000 you need becomes $60,000. Even though we lived in Pleasanton, where everything's really nice, I'm pretty sure he was stressing. That's probably why he is the way he is.”</p>\r\n\t\t\t\t<ImgWrapper extraClass=\"BlogPost__ImgWrapper--right\" src={ObservationsRoom} />\r\n\t\t\t\t<p>He described his father as cold, analytical, and withdrawn. Someone who didn’t communicate much or provide emotional support. Adrian said he had a strained relationship with his parents, yet he found himself going back to the themes of family and growing up, time and time again.</p>\r\n\t\t\t\t<p>In high school, it didn’t seem like Adrian was interested in art as a career. He talked more about being into sports than painting. He didn’t start painting until he got to high school, and by his account, only kept at it because he would get easy A’s. Without knowing much about the art world or considering art as a career, he decided to opt for it anyway.</p>\r\n\t\t\t\t<p>“It wasn’t until a month before applying to college that I actually knew anything. And I was like, ‘Oh shit. There're art schools out there that people go to, to learn about art?’” He applied to the couple art schools he remembered off-the-top of his head. Even after getting accepted into respected art schools, he still wrestled with attending UC San Diego to study statistical economics.</p>\r\n\t\t\t\t<p>Ultimately, his desire to leave Pleasanton and his parents forced him out of California and to the School of the Arts in Chicago. Adrian recalled the shock of realizing how far behind he was when he first got to college: “When I got to school it was like, ‘Fuck! This is nothing like what I was doing! What the fuck am I doing here?’ The very first week I had a critique, and the professor told me, ‘No one cares about your stuff.’”</p>\r\n\t\t\t\t<p>In high school art class, curriculum was taught as more of a trade or craft. Imagination didn’t extend beyond technical know-how. The environment didn’t promote creative endeavor beyond hobby. Further, taking the plunge and going to art school meant that he was on his own. He had entered into an agreement with his dad to take tuition support for art school with the understanding that this would be the last of his support.</p>\r\n\t\t\t\t<h3 className={classes['BlogPost__Pull-Quotes']}>The very first week I had a critique, the professor told me, ‘No one cares about your stuff.’”</h3>\r\n\t\t\t\t<p>It’s during this period that he came to develop his perspective on work and art. He talked a lot about confusion. Not knowing this, or not knowing that. Being in a foreign place and having your perspective on something shattered completely can do that to you.</p>\r\n\t\t\t\t<p>Struggling to find a starting point, Adrian mentioned, “I’m coming from a place where I didn’t know anything. It was like 1,000 doors opened, and I don't know which one to go through.”</p>\r\n\t\t\t\t<p>“I was doing stuff about family because I felt like it was a weighty topic,” he continued. Eventually he avoided this overt messaging. He felt uncomfortable forcing the issue. However, variations on this subject matter would reemerge later under more subtle tones.</p>\r\n\t\t\t\t<p>How did he get to his creative voice? In other interviews, he cites the artists who influenced him: Scheeler, Diebenkorn, Lautrec, Matisse, Albers. Even to the untrained eye, these influences are seen in Adrian’s work. Yet I got the sense that these artists were mainly providing stylistic support. His direction was shaped and developed out of necessity.</p>\r\n\t\t\t\t<p>When Adrian moved to LA five years ago, he didn’t know anyone outside of a single cousin and a friend who moved away shortly after. He lived in a studio off Crenshaw and Adams, which he described as “not the best neighborhood.” Introverted and insecure, he put his focus into painting.</p>\r\n\t\t\t\t<p>“I threw out my bed because I was like, ‘I need more space to paint. That's all that matters because I'm going to fucking die out here.’ I was sleeping in my closet in a sleeping bag for six months. I was like, ‘I need to paint. I need to paint.’”</p>\r\n\t\t\t\t<p>Except creativity wasn’t exploding in this confined space. Adrian explained that there were months in which painting was second to the mental hurdles of justifying his work amidst the agony of self-doubt. Searching for his creative identity, Adrian kept painting, pushing out more and more to the point where “walls started being covered. [He] had these tiny, narrow walk spaces because there's shit everywhere.” Compared to the chaotic environment, Adrian said, “I wanted to be like the surface of the canvas. It was always pristine and nice because I wanted to be like that.”</p>\r\n\t\t\t\t<ImgWrapper extraClass=\"BlogPost__ImgWrapper\" src={ObservationsDesk} />\r\n\t\t\t\t<p>Reduce, reduce, reduce. “In order to simplify the things that were in front of me, I was spending less time doing detail.” His paintings are defined by clean lines, clean canvas, large blocks of color and devoid of clutter and the unnecessary. He yearned for cleanliness and order when life at the time seemed to lack it.</p>\r\n\t\t\t\t<p>We asked him why he chose to focus on images that were recollections of his past. Of all the things he could have painted, the recurring imagery was based on literal memory. We could imagine him in his studio constantly reverting back to his past. It felt instinctual. What was it about his past that made it worth discussing?</p>\r\n\t\t\t\t<p>“I’m very nostalgic. My favorite director is Wong Kar Wai because I think he has this romantic view of things long gone but very clearly influencing you in the present. I think for as long as I remember I have had this thing with how I grew up or how I'm a nobody in the art world. Everyone seems to know more than me, so it's always trying to prove that I have some sort of worth.</p>\r\n\t\t\t\t<p>“For me, in the present I have to figure out or navigate these past things where I was either too young, too immature or not knowledgeable enough to be able to handle them correctly. I worked through that in my own head. I’m still very stuck on those images, but I think nostalgia for things that aren't necessarily good is still present in my painting.\"</p>\r\n\t\t\t\t<h3 className={classes['BlogPost__Pull-Quotes']}>Everyone knows more than me, always trying to prove that I have some sort of worth.</h3>\r\n\t\t\t\t<p>Is he trying to rewrite his history? “In a way,” he said, “it’s a rewriting of how I see things.” If you could make sense of your past, would that allow you to move forward?</p>\r\n\t\t\t\t<p>Memory is fallible, malleable, even disorienting. By actively decluttering memories, Adrian condenses images down to a common denominator. The result is something more universal: colors, lines, and shapes that together become relatable to many.</p>\r\n\t\t\t\t<ImgWrapper extraClass=\"BlogPost__ImgWrapper--right\" src={ObservationsWall} />\r\n\t\t\t\t<p>One effect Adrian imposes on all his work is flattening 3D images into 2D, leaving no space for depth. To do this, he builds the image with geometric pieces that complement each other like a jigsaw puzzle. There's difficulty in distinguishing depth between shapes.</p>\r\n\t\t\t\t<p>“The distance between the vase to the arm of a chair -- they never overlap. The lamp doesn't overlap with the shoulder. The person inside the chair is contained within the exterior, which never happens in real life. Try to take a photo that looks like this painting. It would be impossible because there's too many angles of view that you have to composite together. You would never see just three legs of the chair like that and not see the bottom or the top of the chair.”</p>\r\n\t\t\t\t<p>How should we interpret this? Adrian said, “It's like taking this real-life thing and morphing it into, I don't want to say perfect, but there's a perfect way of representing these images. The lamp is perfect in a way, but in the way that it all comes together.”</p>\r\n\t\t\t\t<p>There's a desire for perfection, but a subtle acknowledgement that perfection is never achievable. Look at the lines and edges carefully. “There is imperfection. If you look close enough, you’ll see these lines aren't exactly straight” because they are drawn by hand.</p>\r\n\t\t\t\t<p>Through the process of flattening, he leaves every shape in direct competition for viewers to see. He even went so far as to remove faces from his work because they stood out too much. He believes this allows you to better appreciate the beauty in the everyday.</p>\r\n\t\t\t\t<p>When we asked Adrian about his inspirations over the years, he actually started with his father. It was a surprising comment given how he talked about their relationship earlier. “He’d never forced me to get A’s. It was just like, ‘You're not working hard enough. You’re not working hard enough. You’re never working hard enough. Why are you doing this if you can work harder on this?’” he recalled as he quoted his father.</p>\r\n\t\t\t\t<p>It’s this singular focus and intense work ethic that characterizes Adrian today. To survive in new environments without any direction, he said, “I didn't have a backup plan because my mentality was, ‘This is all on me, so I'm going to put everything I have into this. Nothing else matters.’” Giving up wasn’t really an option.</p>\r\n\t\t\t\t<p>Given the forum, we wondered if he ever cared to reveal his Asian-American identity through his art. The more we talked about his background, the more we felt like this identity was showing itself through his process, but he wasn’t discussing identity directly in his art. To this he told me about a time in college when an Asian-American professor asked him why he didn’t paint Asian people. Adrian responded that he just painted people: “In my head I was like, ‘How do I paint an Asian person in the style that I do without relying on very stereotypical choices like yellow toned skin or black hair.’”</p>\r\n\t\t\t\t<p>Nevertheless, Adrian was still trying to figure out how he could incorporate identity into his work. He tinkered with some ideas until a friend told him not to force this discussion in his work and that his identity would be built into his artistic choices. His work would reveal it. As an example, Adrian believed his work to be aligned to how people might think about Asian aesthetics – clean, minimal, lacking excess, balanced. These attributes weren’t intentional in that way yet developed over time. One could argue it wasn’t a coincidence.</p>\r\n\t\t\t\t<p>For Asian-Americans with immigrant parents, Adrian felt their parents’ experiences put pressure on them to prove their worth. The immigrant experience looked harder, more daunting. How do you chart a new path that reconciles a desire to create a supportive environment for your work with a respect for the past and the people who wrote it? Sometimes this acknowledgment of the past affects our ability to be completely sure of our own beliefs. Tradition questions evolution. Historical facts dampen the possibilities of the future. “You have your work that you’re set out to do,” Adrian said, “and just have confidence in that... But in doing that craziness, do it extremely hard, as hard as you can.”</p>\r\n\t\t\t\t<ImgWrapper extraClass=\"BlogPost__ImgWrapper--right\" src={ObservationsBack} />\r\n\t\t\t</div>\r\n\t\t);\r\n\t}\r\n}\r\n\r\nexport default Observations;","import React, { Component } from 'react';\r\n\r\nimport ImgWrapper from '../../components/UI/ImgWrapper/ImgWrapper';\r\n\r\nimport classes from './BlogPost.module.css';\r\nimport RunRiverCover from \"../../assets/images/RunRiver/RRN_1.jpg\";\r\nimport RunRiverChairs from \"../../assets/images/RunRiver/RRN_2.jpg\";\r\nimport RunRiverOld from \"../../assets/images/RunRiver/RRN_3.jpg\";\r\nimport RunRiverTalk from \"../../assets/images/RunRiver/RRN_4.jpg\";\r\nimport RunRiverAlex from \"../../assets/images/RunRiver/RRN_5.jpg\";\r\nimport RunRiverHands from \"../../assets/images/RunRiver/RRN_6.jpg\";\r\nimport RunRiverDaniel from \"../../assets/images/RunRiver/RRN_7.jpg\";\r\nimport RunRiverSally from \"../../assets/images/RunRiver/RRN_8.jpg\";\r\nimport RunRiverLaugh from \"../../assets/images/RunRiver/RRN_9.jpg\";\r\n\r\n\r\nclass RunRiver extends Component {\r\n\tcomponentDidMount() {\r\n\t\twindow.scrollTo(0, 0);\r\n\t}\r\n\t\r\n\trender () {\r\n\t\treturn (\r\n\t\t\t<div className={classes.BlogPost}>\r\n\t\t\t\t<ImgWrapper extraClass=\"BlogPost__ImgWrapper--first\" src={RunRiverCover} />\r\n\t\t\t\t<h2 className={[classes.BlogPost__Title, classes['BlogPost__Title--Rewriting']].join(' ')}>Learning to Dance: Run River North</h2>\r\n\t\t\t\t<p>We're not quite sure how to describe 10408 Balboa Blvd and neither can Google Maps. Google’s red pin drops on a large-ish area next to the Valley Academy of Arts and Sciences and Asahi Sushi. The descriptor is literal: 10408 Balboa Blvd.</p>\r\n\t\t\t\t<p>The building’s sign says Valley Korean United Methodist Church. But walking around the complex we see children’s classrooms, senior citizens vigorously playing ping pong, and smoke drifting into the sky from the parking lot.</p>\r\n\t\t\t\t<ImgWrapper extraClass=\"BlogPost__ImgWrapper--right\" src={RunRiverChairs} />\r\n\t\t\t\t<p>We start near the backlot and are guided up the stairs to a room with a coffee bar where we find Sally Kang (keys/vocals) and Daniel Chae (guitar/vocals) of the LA-based band Run River North. Well-dressed and put together, they’re surrounded by a couple acquaintances. Others walk in and out to say hello. Alex Hwang, the front man, arrives not long after to the embrace of those in the room.</p>\r\n\t\t\t\t<p>Without a full-time bassist or drums or, in a past iteration, a violinist, the trio has just come back from a trip to SXSW where they spent nearly a week playing multiple shows and making a run with the press. The band formed in 2011, under their original moniker “Monsters Calling Home,” with six Asian American band members. Two albums and 400 performances later, Run River North would end up going on tour for the first time without three of their original bandmates.</p>\r\n\t\t\t\t<ImgWrapper extraClass=\"BlogPost__ImgWrapper--right\" src={RunRiverOld} />\r\n\t\t\t\t<p>After exchanging introductions, we head down to the “ping pong room,” an empty room with sunlight piercing through old vertical blinds and mirrors covering one wall. We fiddle around with chairs until we settle into an arrangement as if we're about to perform an intervention on the recorder. The interview setting is DIY – reminiscent of a scene from one of their music videos like “Fight to Keep,” the video that enabled the band to play on Jimmy Kimmel Live in 2012. Their Kimmel appearance is widely known among fans, yet less has been written about how their resourcefulness and vulnerability permeates the band’s entire approach. </p>\r\n\t\t\t\t<ImgWrapper extraClass=\"BlogPost__ImgWrapper\" src={RunRiverTalk} />\r\n\t\t\t\t<p>With Kimmel, the band caught fire early. When the band first formed, they committed to making twelve songs in the first year with the goal of getting signed and playing in established venues like Troubadour in LA. “Fight to Keep” just happened to be their second song. But the steps that got them to that point were not clear-cut; it was not obvious they would find such early interest.</p>\r\n\t\t\t\t<p>The six original bandmates did not know each other prior, but all grew up in the San Fernando Valley. The first time Alex crossed paths with Daniel was through the Valley Korean Youth Orchestra where Alex played saxophone. Alex recalls, “There's a solo violinist that we don't know of. And then halfway through, Daniel comes in, and he's the soloist. The conductor's like, ‘Okay, listen up. This is Daniel. You guys all play for him.’” </p>\r\n\t\t\t\t<p>Although Daniel was musically talented, the key spark he later provided was the idea that they could be in a band together making music they wanted to play. Alex watched Daniel’s progression from being in his own “power worship band” to deciding he no longer wanted to play worship music. Instead Daniel’s band shifted to playing songs that sounded more like Jimmy Eat World than Hillsong. Excited after listening to them perform, Alex says, “I wanted to share their music to other people and be like, ‘Hey, this is a band. They happened to be Korean-American, but that had nothing to do with how good they were.’ That plants a seed in my mind that it's possible, and these guys are probably going to be part of it somehow.”</p>\r\n\t\t\t\t<ImgWrapper extraClass=\"BlogPost__ImgWrapper--right\" src={RunRiverAlex} />\r\n\t\t\t\t<p>After playing guitar at coffee shops and doing open mics for several years, Alex decided to try to win a talent competition hosted by Kollaboration, an annual showcase for aspiring Korean-American entertainers. In doing so, he recruited the band and called the group Monsters Calling Home. Already, Alex was incorporating his emerging views on growing up Asian-American into the band’s representation. The name Monsters Calling Home directly addressed what he was hearing from other people about their parents and the struggles of being in an immigrant family. He knew it was relevant because he experienced it with his father as well. “It felt like there was a lot of pain and a lot of drama that it looked like if it wasn't addressed it was going to come up in the way we raise our kids or the way we have relationships with other people,” he remarks. What he saw was deeper than surface-level pain: more problematic than familial issues was that his generation could not adequately express their angst and felt ashamed to tell their stories. He was concerned that his peers would eventually make the same mistakes as their parents without even being aware of it. </p>\r\n\t\t\t\t<h3 className={classes['BlogPost__Pull-Quotes']}>“How do you find hope? How do you dance? How do you celebrate in the midst of all of that?” </h3>\r\n\t\t\t\t<p>“Just because you got hit by your parents and you don't hit your kids doesn't mean you're doing something right and they were doing something wrong. It's a lot more subtle than that,” Alex clarifies, “and I think Monsters Calling Home is definitely a direct reference to my parents. But it was also just a reflection on, ‘Hey, what am I? Am I going to be a different kind of monster, and can I be okay with that?’” </p>\r\n\t\t\t\t<ImgWrapper extraClass=\"BlogPost__ImgWrapper--right\" src={RunRiverHands} />\r\n\t\t\t\t<p>Monsters Calling Home performed at the Nokia Theater for Kollaboration among other musical acts and entertainers. Though they believed they had a good chance of winning, they shockingly lost out to the “Yo-yo Guy.” Alex recounts, “what happened was all the judges had a favorite and everyone's second was the Yo-yo Guy. [When] the points came out, the Yo-yo Guy had the most points. And even the Yo-yo Guy was… everyone was confused.” Although their initial motivation to win the Kollaboration competition was denied, the band was surprised by the response that came after the show.</p>\r\n\t\t\t\t<p>Endorsements from Angry Asian Man, Phil Yu, and Buzz Bands LA music blogger, Kevin Bronson, encouraged the band to keep going. For Alex, the response was enough for him to quit his job at CAA to see how far they could get in a year. Daniel notes, “All of us just… fell into it, but it took a lot of sacrifice on [Alex’s] part.” Building on that buzz, in 2012 they played at USC Springfest alongside mainstream names like Wolfgang Gartner, Macklemore, and Anberlin. The band actually performed acapella as they didn’t have any gear but because of this, was asked by Anberlin to join them on their acoustic tour. At that time, John Chong (original drummer), Joe Chun (original bassist), Daniel and Alex were in their early-to-mid 20s; Sally was 19; Jennifer Rim (original violinist) had just graduated high school. </p>\r\n\t\t\t\t<p>Were they hesitant about committing to such a big endeavor? Between making music, practicing, and going on tour, it’s hard to imagine there was time left for much else. Alex and Daniel provide conflicting answers. Alex then corrects himself saying there is still some hesitance today, but back then they were getting so many compelling opportunities it was hard to say no. “I think this is a very important question,” Alex starts, “the fact that you're asking about our parents. That's an Asian-American question. If we were white, I don't see you asking that question.” It triggers a discussion about where this dynamic comes from. </p>\r\n\t\t\t\t<p>The natural response is that immigrant parents, although they took risks emigrating to the U.S., prefer the stable and safe path. They shirk uncertainty, perhaps because it was too painful for them as they were finding their own way. There’s an embedded pragmatism especially for those who did not fully realize their ambitions. The concern is whether this perspective discourages creative souls from pursuing artistic paths. </p>\r\n\t\t\t\t<h3 className={classes['BlogPost__Pull-Quotes']}>“Am I going to be a different kind of monster, and can I be okay with that?” </h3>\r\n\t\t\t\t<p>Alex’s self-confidence guided him in conversations with his parents to be bolder about his stance. He found ways to become financially independent to eliminate the money question. Those factors allowed him and John Chong to set the example for the younger bandmates, to show that it was possible. “It took a lot of fights… lots of arguing matches and storming out the door,” Daniel recalls, “And my dad literally saying, ‘leave this house.’ But then him not meaning it. That's what it took to get our points across. Looking back, as dramatic as it sounds, that was the only vehicle for clear communication.” We wonder how many hopefuls never made it past this stage of convincing their parents to pursue the undefined path. </p>\r\n\t\t\t\t<ImgWrapper extraClass=\"BlogPost__ImgWrapper\" src={RunRiverDaniel} />\r\n\t\t\t\t<p>We had been curious about how the Asian image and background of the bandmates would affect the audiences listening or watching their performances. Does identity and image play a part in whether others could relate to the artist? The band’s first album entitled “Run River North” invoked American folk sounds with familiar, universal narratives – “that sense of wanting to create a home and then not doing a perfect job of it.” Alex argues this combination was not limiting by race but does acknowledge there was an initial barrier for non-Asians to understand the group. Daniel describes trying to win the room every night to “stunned” audiences who couldn’t believe what they were seeing on stage. He quips, “Even now some of our biggest fans are from the south, like in Alabama or in Arkansas... You would think they would be the most prejudice. But I think when there's a real connection in that room, they're still our biggest fans.” </p>\r\n\t\t\t\t<p>When we get past the superficial and connect on shared human experiences, does race and ethnicity have any further relevance in the relationship between artist and audience? Alex’s incredulous reaction to the image question makes us think this isn’t a subject matter Run River North confronts any longer. In fact, we get the sense that while he embraces the band’s identity, he does not want it to overtake what the band stands for. In other words: Hey, this is a band. They happen to be Korean-American, but that has nothing to do with how good they are. Identity may have been a core topic to address early on, but the band continues to move forward. </p>\r\n\t\t\t\t<h3 className={classes['BlogPost__Pull-Quotes']}>“That's an Asian-American question. If we were white, I don't see you asking that question.” </h3>\t\r\n\t\t\t\t<p>For their second album, the band bet that a change in sound and songwriting approach would help them reach more listeners. “What changed was, we didn't catapult up like the way Fleet Foxes, Head and the Heart, [Mumford & Sons] did with our songs. We had to change, or we were going to either adapt or die,” Alex reasons. To continue making music as a career, the band decided they needed to reach larger audiences which required a level of “sacrifice and compromise.” More of the band got involved in the songwriting process. They evolved the sound to progressive rock overtures in the vein of The Killers, Arctic Monkeys, and The Strokes. It was what Alex had been striving for early on, but back then he didn’t know “how to marry the two: the folk songs that [he] wanted to sing with the bravado and the pop rock sensibility.” In the next EP, they will continue to advance the sound, augmenting it with more digital effects. </p>\r\n\t\t\t\t<p>The more significant change they will make, however, is to observe less and experience more. Their first two albums tried to make sense of situations and circumstances. But after going through a long and painful rift within the band following the first tour to eventually losing three bandmates for good, Sally, Daniel, and Alex now seek joy. “How do you find joy after the aftermath and what does that look like? How do you find hope? How do you dance? How do you celebrate in the midst of all of that?” Alex asks. They’re searching for solutions to discover joy beyond embracing the escapism of the day. Even after playing sets without a drummer or a bassist, having close to zero in the band’s bank account, and wishing just to make it out alive through the next tour, Run River North remains optimistic. “I think joy is holding your reality, which is probably broken,” Alex answers, “and still being happy and finding hope in it.”</p>\r\n\t\t\t\t<ImgWrapper extraClass=\"BlogPost__ImgWrapper--right\" src={RunRiverSally} />\r\n\t\t\t\t<p>After the interview, we find out 10408 Balboa Blvd is also a barbeque joint. We share pork belly over rice provided by Daniel’s brother who smoked the meat onsite in the parking lot. It is quietly enjoyed by us and an elderly white couple. </p>\r\n\t\t\t\t<p>Perhaps to understand this place is another way to understand the band. The place is more than the church that brought the band together and supported them through their growth. There is a sense of grace that extends beyond spirituality and realizes the practicality necessary for the struggles in life. It is a place where compassion is color-blind. This ethos remains the foundation for Run River North. The bandmates recognize they’re fighting for something greater than themselves and find meaning in their challenges. As they venture through their next phase as a trio, they’ll get to see if “the ground of Run River North is still fertile.”  </p>\r\n\t\t\t\t<ImgWrapper extraClass=\"BlogPost__ImgWrapper--right\" src={RunRiverLaugh} />\r\n\t\t\t</div>\r\n\t\t);\r\n\t}\r\n}\r\n\r\nexport default RunRiver;","import React, { Component } from 'react';\r\n\r\nimport ImgWrapper from '../../components/UI/ImgWrapper/ImgWrapper';\r\n\r\nimport classes from './BlogPost.module.css';\r\nimport MaxB_1 from \"../../assets/images/MaxB/MAXB_1.jpg\";\r\nimport MaxB_kitchen from \"../../assets/images/MaxB/MAXB_2.jpg\";\r\nimport MaxB_cooking from \"../../assets/images/MaxB/MAXB_3.jpg\";\r\nimport MaxB_pot from \"../../assets/images/MaxB/MAXB_4.jpg\";\r\nimport MaxB_potempty from \"../../assets/images/MaxB/MAXB_5.jpg\";\r\nimport MaxB_dessert from \"../../assets/images/MaxB/MAXB_6.jpg\";\r\nimport MaxB_table from \"../../assets/images/MaxB/MAXB_7.jpg\";\r\nimport MaxB_closeup from \"../../assets/images/MaxB/MAXB_8.jpg\";\r\nimport MaxB_jars from \"../../assets/images/MaxB/MAXB_10.jpg\";\r\nimport MaxB_behind from \"../../assets/images/MaxB/MAXB_11.jpg\";\r\nimport MaxB_tattoo from \"../../assets/images/MaxB/MAXB_12.jpg\";\r\nimport MaxB_side from \"../../assets/images/MaxB/MAXB_13.jpg\";\r\n\r\nclass MaxB extends Component {\r\n\tcomponentDidMount() {\r\n\t\twindow.scrollTo(0, 0);\r\n\t}\r\n\t\r\n\trender () {\r\n\t\treturn (\r\n\t\t\t<div className={classes.BlogPost}>\r\n\t\t\t\t<ImgWrapper extraClass=\"BlogPost__ImgWrapper--first\" src={MaxB_1} />\r\n\t\t\t\t<h2 className={[classes.BlogPost__Title, classes['BlogPost__Title--Rewriting']].join(' ')}>Cook Like a Grandma: Max Boonthanakit, Chef</h2>\r\n\t\t\t\t<p>There is a definite peculiarity to chef Max Boonthanakit’s palate.

But, by his admission, Max hasn’t cooked French food in a professional setting, so this was not an obvious route. </p>\r\n\t\t\t\t<p>By age 27, Max has worked at various Los Angeles hotspots such as The Bazaar by José Andrés, ink., and Republique. His latest achievement was opening Nightshade, which will inevitably join the other names as a fixture in LA. Sprinkled in between are stints at a boba shop, a chain fish house, and a private club. There is no pattern, no calculated movements. </p>\r\n\t\t\t\t<p>“I’m drawn to anything delicious,” Max explains, “My parents like eating well, too. They’d take us to nice restaurants. My brother and I, at ten, would be like, ‘I want foie gras! I want beef tartare! I want the tasting menu!’” Chasing exciting flavors became an early sport for Max and still guides him today.</p>\r\n\t\t\t\t<p>Max’s first foray into cooking was at 13 when he spent time at an aunt’s noodle restaurant in Georgia. Later, at the family dinner table, his father smiles as he recalls how he had hoped Max would have had a terrible experience, so he wouldn’t pursue cooking. But between spending time cooking and playing video games, cooking won out. Were his parents truly supportive? He feels lucky they were very open. Coming from a creative family (his father is a storyboard artist and mother used to be in fashion), he says his parents just told him “not to half-ass it.” </p>\r\n\t\t\t\t<ImgWrapper extraClass=\"BlogPost__ImgWrapper\" src={MaxB_cooking} />\r\n\t\t\t\t<p>Max grew up in Atlanta which had its pockets of Asian communities. But in school, Max was one of a few Asians and that led to early encounters with a pervasive but non-threatening kind of racism: “in the south, racism is just there. Everyone just ends up accepting it… The janitor used to call me ‘wonton.’ It was crazy now that I think about it.” Even with these experiences with racial insensitivity, Max displays an acute awareness of various cultures which become fodder for his work. He engages often with new cuisine and all its ingredients, methodology, and flavor accents and in the process, develops empathy with the people who grew up on it. </p>\r\n\t\t\t\t<p>When Max moved to Diamond Bar, California in his early teens, he realized being an Asian in a predominantly Asian city wasn’t a shoo-in for inclusion. There, he faced norms that went counter to what he familiarized himself with in Atlanta – cool was defined by your SAT score not how many drinks you could take down at a party. “I was never in the crowd, but I was always outside which I think is good, eventually, because you end up taking in more,” Max acknowledges. Perhaps it is this feeling of being an outsider that allows him the freedom to walk the planes of culture in search for innovative flavors. Rather than look externally for validation, Max embraces cooking with soul. </p>\r\n\t\t\t\t<p><b>Refractor</b></p>\r\n\t\t\t\t<p><i>Max</i></p>\r\n\t\t\t\t<p><b>How are you putting emotion or soul into your food?</b></p>\r\n\t\t\t\t<p><i>I like to capture moments in time, especially with dessert, like the [coconut mousse at Nightshade]. It reminds me of a vacation on a cruise ship, like having a piña colada. I like to capture really nice moments in time and try to create a dish out of that. The almond one with the orange bowls: that's like after you finish a really good dim sum meal and you get the almond tofu and the oranges. It captures that little moment.</i></p>\r\n\t\t\t\t<p><i>Yesterday, [my girlfriend] Wendy and I, we were eating shaved ice, and we were like, “this is so fucking good!” I want to be able to capture this feeling of eating brown sugar, Taiwanese shaved ice, and condensed milk. So then it hit me. I got an idea for a dish that I'm probably going to do in Thailand now. It's a brown sugar sorbet with a reduced milk cream on it, and that's it. Super simple, but it can't be an exact replica of what you're doing. You can’t put boba in. If you have boba in that dish, it's going to ruin it. Even though the one I'm eating right now has boba and pudding. It's amazing, but if I put boba in my dish, it totally kills the point for me.</i></p>\r\n\t\t\t\t<ImgWrapper extraClass=\"BlogPost__ImgWrapper--right\" src={MaxB_pot} />\r\n\t\t\t\t<p><b>Is it because you’re trying to capture the essence, not trying to be literal about it?</b></p>\r\n\t\t\t\t<p><i>Yeah, I'm just trying to capture that feeling, and I want people to think about it like, “oh, this reminds me of something, and that makes me happy, but I don't really know what.”</i></p>\r\n\t\t\t\t<p><i>Not everyone likes the desserts [at Nightshade]. I've seen a lot of reviews where they didn't like the coconut dessert, or they didn't understand the almond one. And I understand that. I don't really get upset cause there's dishes that I don't really care for, and ones I like that other people don't. I try to give people enough options.</i></p>\r\n\t\t\t\t<p><i>The technique I use the most when I cook or create something is to put myself in someone else’s shoes, usually it’s a grandma.</i></p>\r\n\t\t\t\t<p><b>Why grandma?</b></p>\r\n\t\t\t\t<p><i>Cause they cook with the most soul. They’re not going to be precise. There should be a little bit of this and a little bit of that. It ends up just tasting good.</i></p>\r\n\t\t\t\t<p><i>I’ll be like, “I’m a Thai grandma, but I was on a boat. It crashed, and we got stuck onshore in Mexico. I have these ingredients now. How am I going to create something as soulful here with these ingredients?</i></p>\r\n\t\t\t\t<ImgWrapper extraClass=\"BlogPost__ImgWrapper--right\" src={MaxB_potempty} />\r\n\t\t\t\t<p>For Max, the dishes he creates mimic life and often refer to memories and experiences. He recognizes the fluidity of memory. When describing the inspiration for the coconut dessert, he thought about “cruises, ocean breeze, piña coladas, and sand.”</p>\r\n\t\t\t\t<ImgWrapper extraClass=\"BlogPost__ImgWrapper--right\" src={MaxB_dessert} />\r\n\t\t\t\t<p>“For me, the vessel had to be rough to represent sand. It helps that it looks like a coconut. When you look at the dessert, you're like, ‘why is the color green? It's really weird.’ It only makes sense to me cause my uncle used to always sing that song about putting the lime in the coconut. It always stuck with me.”</p>\r\n\t\t\t\t<p>He also doesn’t try to be precise about his work. One example he gives is how the guava cheese dessert he developed at Nightshade is layered with a coat of marble-looking white chocolate. It’s a play on the marble tables at the restaurant. But while his cook had once labored with trying to make the marble look perfect, Max demurred with the observation that no marble looks the same. To replicate completely is a futile exercise in his mind. </p>\r\n\t\t\t\t<ImgWrapper extraClass=\"BlogPost__ImgWrapper--right\" src={MaxB_table} />\r\n\t\t\t\t<p>He makes parallels to art and paintings. There was a time when art held a more utilitarian purpose, visually interpreting scenes, objects, and people to varying degrees. But with the invention of photography, artists then faced the reality that the camera served this function better. “Now that you’ve reached that point of [visual] mastery, there’s no soul anymore,” Max claims. Like the progression of modern art, Max cares much more about feeling, human connection, and concoctions of the subconscious. </p>\r\n\t\t\t\t<p>It’s no surprise he ultimately creates dishes that he thinks his friends would enjoy. His “basic palate” doesn’t allow him to make objective decisions about whether a dish is truly complete. Rather, he’s encouraged to receive input from others and study their reactions to his food: “cause if people were to eat like me, they’d get sick... I like asking and studying what other people eat and what other people like. I love that moment when someone eats something and their eyebrows raise up, and a lot of people don’t even notice they do that.”</p>\r\n\t\t\t\t<ImgWrapper extraClass=\"BlogPost__ImgWrapper--right\" src={MaxB_closeup} />\r\n\t\t\t\t<p>Opening Nightshade at 27 is an incredible accomplishment. Even chefs twice his age may never get the chance to pull off something similar. The way he speaks about the experience of getting started is so nonchalant, it’s as if he’d done it before. The obstacles that would have threatened other chefs — delays in opening, obtaining licenses, adhering to fire codes — don’t appear to have made a dent in his psyche. And yet, Max swiftly moves onto his next challenge with ever-increasing ambition. </p>\r\n\t\t\t\t<p>When Alain Ducasse came calling, Max found the opportunity to be a timely way to shake things up. A self-proclaimed lover of change, Max was initially deterred but excited by the fact that he hadn’t ever done French food. On his approach with the new restaurant, Max explains:</p>\r\n\t\t\t\t<p>“You have to think of a dish in a French mentality, which is hard to explain. This goes back to putting yourself into someone's shoes. Like I'll put myself into a French grandma’s shoes and be like, ‘Now I'm just stuck in Thailand. How am I going to create this initially French thing that tastes special, in Thailand, using different ingredients from Asia. It's going to be fun, but scary at the same time.”</p>\r\n\t\t\t\t<ImgWrapper extraClass=\"BlogPost__ImgWrapper--right\" src={MaxB_jars} />\r\n\t\t\t\t<p>Although Max is half-Thai (and half-Taiwanese), going back to Thailand didn’t spark any notions of identity-searching. He mentions he is drawn to the place and it helps that he has family there, but as far as ethnic-connection goes, “I feel not Thai.” The journey is less pilgrimage to the motherland, and more of his expansion of culinary vocabulary. </p>\r\n\t\t\t\t<p>As we spend more time speaking about his history, it’s shocking how many different types of cuisines he has learned to cook over the years and how he’s still willing to learn more. At a certain point, wouldn’t he want to settle down and master one? And doing Asian fusion at Nightshade, one would think he would’ve continued to focus on Asian cuisine. </p>\r\n\t\t\t\t<p>With constant experimentation and blending of experiences, memories, cultures, Max is intent on uncovering new, genre-bending dishes. Given the tight connection between food and culture, we wondered if Max even believed there was a place for authentic cuisines. He's wired to subvert the “traditional” yet still maintains respect for authenticity. There's a fine line he treads. </p>\r\n\t\t\t\t<p><b>What even makes Thai food Thai, anyways? Nowadays everything's blended together. Orange chicken in the U.S. is not really Chinese.</b></p>\r\n\t\t\t\t<p><i>Thai food tastes Thai just because the ingredients they use are Thai. The fun thing about cooking is substituting stuff. That's what I love doing. Say you're making the larb dish. It's pork, toasted rice, fish sauce, lime, shallots. What if you switched all that shit around? Instead of toasting rice, you toasted buckwheat. Instead of lime, use passion fruit. Instead of fish sauce, you use something crazy.</i></p>\r\n\t\t\t\t<p><b>It's kind of interesting, though. When chefs are doing these innovative dishes, it's a bit heretical because there's a traditional way to make a certain kind of dish that's happened for centuries, and now you're smashing it. How do you think about that?</b></p>\r\n\t\t\t\t<p><i>But then when you think about it, there's those dishes, but there's also good versions of those dishes where it's not so traditional. To you, it might taste traditional. In Korea, there's probably someone who makes the best kimchi, but everyone makes kimchi. There's going to be someone who has one that's a little better because maybe, instead of oysters, they put anchovies it. There's definitely leeway with anything, even traditional cooking.</i></p>\r\n\t\t\t\t<p><b>So does that mean you don’t believe in authentic food?</b></p>\r\n\t\t\t\t<p><i>I do, but I think authenticity comes from more of the thought and the feeling instead of the ingredients themselves.</i></p>\r\n\t\t\t\t<ImgWrapper extraClass=\"BlogPost__ImgWrapper\" src={MaxB_behind} />\r\n\t\t\t\t<p>What seems radical today become the traditions of tomorrow. Why let history get in the way of new flavors? We ponder the banh mi which originally was rooted in French ingredients. At a certain point in Vietnam’s history, the French baguette sandwich was replaced with ingredients endemic to Vietnam – substituting ham, butter, and cheese with pork sausage, cilantro, cucumber, pickled carrots, and pickled daikon. Now the banh mi is tightly associated with Vietnam and its culture.   </p>\r\n\t\t\t\t<p>To be able to reinvent is to first imagine how something can be. Max believes his greatest strength is his ability to be open while he thinks the majority of chefs are close-minded. He elaborates, “They want to say they’re open-minded, but they’ll say, ‘That’s not the right technique.’” This mentality may help explain why he could leave a situation that was good and that was working. </p>\r\n\t\t\t\t<p>What drives Max? At first, he responds that he “really likes material things. I want a Range Rover... I want to be able to travel. I want to have nice things, so I’d better be good at the thing I'm doing.” Prodding a bit further he reveals, “I have this really weird vision for myself. I want to get to the point where I'm 50 years old, and I'm a legend. I don’t know how to get there, but that’s what I envision. When they talk about me cooking, at 50 years old, I'm like this culinary god. I know that’s where I want to be. I'm nowhere close, but that’s what is pushing me.” </p>\r\n\t\t\t\t<ImgWrapper extraClass=\"BlogPost__ImgWrapper--right\" src={MaxB_tattoo} />\r\n\t\t\t\t<p>There's an incredible focus on food and food alone. Throughout our conversation, despite our best efforts to analyze and dissect his motivations, Max avoids over-intellectualizing his approach. \"At the end of the day, it’s proving to yourself you can do it. Because if I'm not going to cure cancer, I might as well get really good at the thing that I do and let the people that are curing cancer have really good food.” </p>\r\n\t\t\t\t<ImgWrapper extraClass=\"BlogPost__ImgWrapper--right\" src={MaxB_side} />\r\n\t\t\t</div>\r\n\t\t);\r\n\t}\r\n}\r\n\r\nexport default MaxB;","import React, { Component } from 'react';\r\nimport { Route, BrowserRouter, Switch, Redirect } from 'react-router-dom';\r\n\r\nimport Layout from './hoc/Layout/Layout';\r\nimport Home from './containers/Home/Home';\r\nimport About from './containers/About/About';\r\nimport Stories from './containers/Stories/Stories';\r\nimport Contact from './containers/Contact/Contact';\r\nimport Observations from './containers/BlogPost/Observations';\r\nimport RunRiver from './containers/BlogPost/RunRiver'\r\nimport MaxB from './containers/BlogPost/MaxB'\r\n\r\nclass App extends Component {\r\n\trender () {\r\n\t\treturn (\r\n\t\t\t<BrowserRouter>\r\n\t\t\t\t<Layout>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t{(setMainBackground, hideMainBackground)  => (\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<Switch>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<Route path=\"/\" exact render={(props) => <Home {...props} hideMainBackground={hideMainBackground} setMainBackground={setMainBackground} />} />\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<Route path=\"/about\" component={About} />\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<Route path=\"/contact\" component={Contact} />\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<Route path=\"/stories\" component={Stories} />\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<Route path=\"/run_river_north_learning_to_dance\" component={RunRiver}/>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<Route path=\"/max_boonthanakit_cook_like_a_grandma\" component={MaxB}/>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<Route path=\"/adrian_kay_wong_rewriting_the_past\" component={Observations}/>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<Redirect to=\"/\" />\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</Switch>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t)}\r\n\t\t\t\t</Layout>\r\n\t\t\t</BrowserRouter>\r\n\t\t);\r\n\t}\r\n}\r\n\r\nexport default App;","import React from 'react';\r\nimport ReactDOM from 'react-dom';\r\nimport { BrowserRouter } from 'react-router-dom';\r\n\r\nimport './index.css';\r\nimport App from './App';\r\n\r\nconst app = (\r\n\t<BrowserRouter>\r\n\t\t<App />\r\n\t</BrowserRouter>\r\n);\r\n\r\nReactDOM.render(app, document.getElementById('root'));"],"sourceRoot":""}
